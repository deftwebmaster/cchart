      <div class="line">And here's the part that still haunts me the most—</div>
      <div class="line">I was good at my job, I wasn't even close</div>
      <div class="line">To gettin caught, gettin called, gettin seen</div>
      <div class="line">Best manager they had and I was never clean</div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Years of loyalty, years of respect</div>
      <div class="line">Every coworker, manager—gone in a sec</div>
      <div class="line">Ghosted by people I showed up for daily</div>
      <div class="line">The moment I cracked they abandoned me plainly</div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Not a single text, not a single call</div>
      <div class="line">The functional drunk wasn't functional, that's all</div>
      <div class="line">I was useful 'til I wasn't, then I was nothin</div>
      <div class="line">Years of service and they gave me exactly that much and</div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">That's when I learned what the mask really cost</div>
      <div class="line">Not just my health—every person I thought</div>
      <div class="line">Gave a shit about me? Transactional at best</div>
      <div class="line">I was a function, not a human, just like the rest</div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">So nah, not sympathy—I'm not here for that</div>
      <div class="line">Just documentin the data, just statin the fact</div>
