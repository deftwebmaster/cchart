    </header>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Living honest now but I still gotta lie</div>
      <div class="line">To the people who raised me just to keep the peace alive</div>
      <div class="line">Dad don't see me, he sees what he assumes</div>
      <div class="line">A loser, a failure, malicious, a fool</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Needed help with rent again, heard the pause on the line</div>
      <div class="line">That silence said everything, didn't need the sign</div>
      <div class="line">I'm working the job, working hard, working every hour</div>
      <div class="line">Doing everything he prescribed and it's still not enough power</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">To make him see me as anything but a drain</div>
      <div class="line">Sorry I'm not wealthy, sorry I can't explain</div>
      <div class="line">The corners of reality I've seen that he hasn't</div>
      <div class="line">The dark that would break him if he had to imagine it</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">But he'll never ask, and I'll never tell</div>
      <div class="line">Just bridge the gap with his money and swallow the shame well</div>
      <div class="line">He built his life clean, never crawled through the mud</div>
      <div class="line">Can't explain the cost of survival to someone who never bled blood</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Step mom texts me like we're in the same boat</div>
      <div class="line">"People like us who are depressed and anxious" and I quote</div>
      <div class="line">"Can only do this, need that, fucked by God from the start"</div>
      <div class="line">She builds a we that I never signed up to be part</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">She ignored me growing up, mistreated Amy too</div>
      <div class="line">Now she wants connection? Now she wants to be crew?</div>
      <div class="line">Some days I wish she'd go back to the silence</div>
      <div class="line">Give me a reason to cut her, give me the license</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Is that wrong? To hope she gives me an out?</div>
      <div class="line">A clean break instead of this slow bleed of doubt?</div>
      <div class="line">But she stays just kind enough, just present enough</div>
      <div class="line">To keep me tangled in a bond I never wanted to love</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Amy's the only one who might hold the full story</div>
      <div class="line">But I've seen what my darkness does, it isn't pretty</div>
      <div class="line">She's got her own shit, her business, her grind</div>
      <div class="line">I won't be the cloud that blocks her sunshine</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">One time I almost told her everything, late night</div>
      <div class="line">She asked if I was okay, voice soft, kitchen light</div>
      <div class="line">I opened my mouth and saw her face already bracing</div>
      <div class="line">Closed it again. Some truths aren't worth the taking.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">So I ration the real, give pieces not wholes</div>
      <div class="line">Protect the people I love from the depth of the holes</div>
      <div class="line">Or maybe protect the truce that keeps me upright</div>
      <div class="line">Hard to tell the difference at the end of the night</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">The answer's both—I'm shielding them and me</div>
      <div class="line">From the friction that comes when they finally see</div>
      <div class="line">That I'm not the broken one, not like they need</div>
      <div class="line">I'm just tired of being a mirror for their stories to feed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Blood don't mean understanding, love don't mean seen</div>
      <div class="line">I'm the most honest I've been—still caught in between</div>
      <div class="line">The man I actually am and the man they require</div>
      <div class="line">One foot in the truth, one foot in the fire</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse finale" id="finale">
      <div class="line">I'm not bitter about it, not anymore</div>
      <div class="line">Just documenting the cost, settling the score</div>
      <div class="line">I can't make them see me, and I'm done with the mission</div>
      <div class="line closer">I walk honest alone—their blindness ain't my prison</div>
    </div>
