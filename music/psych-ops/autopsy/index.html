    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Here lies the version of me that never made it out</div>
      <div class="line">Seventeen years old when the bottle found his mouth</div>
      <div class="line">By nineteen he was daily, by twenty-one a slave</div>
      <div class="line">Started drinkin legally already diggin his grave</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">I don't know who he was before the poison set in</div>
      <div class="line">Just a kid with a future that never got to begin</div>
      <div class="line">Can't mourn someone I never got the chance to meet</div>
      <div class="line">Can't miss a foundation when you never had the concrete</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">So this ain't rediscovery, this is discovery</div>
      <div class="line">First time meetin myself without the coverup of the</div>
      <div class="line">Chemicals I used to fill the space where a person should be</div>
      <div class="line">Thirty-something years old and I'm just startin to see</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Ambition died first—I was gonna be somethin</div>
      <div class="line">Entrepreneur dreams, big plans, not just bummin</div>
      <div class="line">Now I'm entry level, startin over from scratch</div>
      <div class="line">Same applications as a high school kid—how's that for a catch</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">The version that died had a shot, had a lane</div>
      <div class="line">Had a decade head start that went straight down the drain</div>
      <div class="line">Every year I drank was a year I didn't build</div>
      <div class="line">Every blackout a blueprint that never got filled</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">He almost made it once—three months clean and countin</div>
      <div class="line">Rehab at the Abbey, thought I'd finally found the mountain</div>
      <div class="line">Learned the lessons, did the work, felt the clarity</div>
      <div class="line">But I didn't build the systems, just borrowed the sobriety</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Day 100 I collapsed, fell right back in the hole</div>
      <div class="line">Turns out willpower alone don't save a soul</div>
      <div class="line">That version died thinkin he could white-knuckle through</div>
      <div class="line">Didn't know what I know now—you gotta engineer the new</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Cause of death? A thousand cuts, not a single blow</div>
      <div class="line">Bled out slow over years that I'll never get to know</div>
      <div class="line">Every mornin I chose the bottle over the life</div>
      <div class="line">Every night I drowned the kid who could've had a wife</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Could've had a career, could've had a path</div>
      <div class="line">Could've done the math before the math did the aftermath</div>
      <div class="line">But he didn't. And he's gone. And I'm what's left.</div>
      <div class="line">The version that survived by acceptin his death</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">So here's the burial—I'm puttin him in the ground</div>
      <div class="line">Not with tears, not with grief, not a sorrowful sound</div>
      <div class="line">Just a clinical goodbye to the man I couldn't save</div>
      <div class="line">I had to let him die so I could crawl out of the grave</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Do I mourn him? Nah. He kept me stuck for years.</div>
      <div class="line">Do I miss him? Nah. He was drownin in his fears.</div>
      <div class="line">Is he still in me? Maybe. Traces in the code.</div>
      <div class="line">But I'm runnin different software down a different road</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <div class="line">Current Matt has systems, frameworks, architecture</div>
      <div class="line">Builder mentality, not a beggar at the lecture</div>
      <div class="line">I didn't find myself, I'm buildin him from scratch</div>
      <div class="line">The version that died couldn't do that—and that's a fact</div>
    </div>

    <div class="verse finale" id="finale">
      <div class="line">So goodbye to the ghost, I'm done carryin his weight</div>
      <div class="line">I survived by killin the part that wanted to stay</div>
      <div class="line">The version that died is the reason I'm still here</div>
      <div class="line closer">I killed him myself. And I'd do it again without fear.</div>
